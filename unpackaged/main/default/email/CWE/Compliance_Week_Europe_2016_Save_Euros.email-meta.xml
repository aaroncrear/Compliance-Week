    <textOnly>Greetings {!Contact.FirstName},

I was unable to reach you by phone today but did leave a voicemail message. I wanted to extend a personal invitation for you or a colleague, to join us at the upcoming Compliance Week Europe conference, 7-8 November 2016 .  Please, see your pre-approved discount code below.

Further discounts may be available if you care to contact me.

This year there is also a new certification workshop on 9 November, for which Attendees are eligible to receive 14 CPD credits.

As in past years, it will be held at the Crowne Plaza in Brussels, and the speaker line-up and agenda is shaping up nicely.  

A sample of key sessions are:
•             Identifying fraud in your organisation
