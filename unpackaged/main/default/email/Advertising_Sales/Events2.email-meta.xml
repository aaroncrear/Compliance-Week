    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Compliance Week has two international events which we’ll host this fall. I’d like to see if {!Account.Name} would be interested in sponsorship.

Our European event will be held in October in Brussels, and our Middle Eastern event in Dubai in November. Here is a brief outline of each event:


Compliance Week Europe 2015 - October 26 &amp; 27 in Brussels. Conference designed to help legal, audit, risk &amp; compliance executives understand how to build and manage their compliance and risk programs more effectively. Topics to be discussed include anti-corruption laws and enforcement, conducting a corporate internal investigation, due diligence, data privacy, crafting a code of conduct, whistleblowing, creating an ethical culture, etc. Approximately 150 to 175 executives from global public companies will be in attendance.  The cost for Presenting Sponsorship is $22,400 USD and includes two speaking positions, an exhibit display table, access to all leads for marketing and branding. The event website is: http://conference.complianceweek.com/cw-europe/home-cw-europe.aspx.

Compliance Week Dubai 2015 - November 17th, 2015, at the Jumeirah Emirates Towers. The event is a one day conference designed to discuss the risk &amp; compliance problems that all large multinational organizations face when doing business in the Middle East. It will have a sharp focus to the solutions that compliance executives have found.  The content will be ‘industry agnostic’ and will focus more on the leadership and strategy of developing a strong corporate compliance function. It will cover issue such as corporate investigations, accounting fraud, testing internal controls, and similar operational issues. Attending the event will be 120 to 150 cross-industry compliance executives with a large percentage from the financial services industry.

Please let me know if you would like to schedule a call to discuss or receive full details on either event, thanks for your consideration.
