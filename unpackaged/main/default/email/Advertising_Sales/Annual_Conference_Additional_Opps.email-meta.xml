    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

With about a month to go to the Annual Compliance Week Conference, we have a few remaining sponsorship options available. This represents a prime opportunity to reach 400-500 compliance executives at global public companies. The event runs May 18-20 at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington D.C.

The presenting sponsors have been identified, but we still have the following available:


Pocket Agenda -$3,500. For convenience purposes and quick reference, Compliance Week will print out a multi page (folding) condensed agenda. Each of the 450 attendees will receive this condensed agenda. The sponsor receives branding on the front cover and logo and description within the pages.

Wi-Fi Sponsorship -$6,000. Free Wi-Fi to be provided for all delegates during the 3 day event, courtesy of sponsor. To include:

Password will be sponsor name
Card with Wi-Fi instructions given to all at registration, and additional 100 printed for distribution
Signage with Wi-Fi Instructions, and Sponsors Logo, at Registration and in multiple locations
Recognition at the start of each session on screens in each meeting room

Event App Sponsor -$6,000. A large number of the 450-500 event delegates, and speakers, use our event app to navigate the event. The App Sponsor will receive additional branding in the app. To include:

Welcome screen with Sponsor logo
Logo placement on each App area: sessions, speakers, etc.
Card with App download instructions given at registration, and additional 100 printed for distribution
