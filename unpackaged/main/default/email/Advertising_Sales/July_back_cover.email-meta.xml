    <subject>Compliance Week July Print Edition - Space Available</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We are working to close the July print edition of Compliance Week and have space available for a full page advertisement on the back cover. This is the most visible position in the magazine.

I’d like to see if you would be interested in the position. Because it&apos;s late, we&apos;d be willing to give a nice discount and include 25k online banner impressions at no additional cost.

Rate card for the position is $7,150, I would reduce to $6,250. It would generate nice print and online exposure for your firm. Materials for the print ad would be due by noon tomorrow, Tuesday the 14th (this is a firm deadline).  Editorial in the edition will look at:


Defining compliance program effectiveness
Spotting the difference between &apos;significant deficiency&apos; and &apos;material weakness&apos;
Practical implications of the Yates Memo
Accounting leaders need a wake-up call on revenue recognition
New revenue rules prompt wide variety of adoption strategies
The many facets of a data breach
Companies now have federal remedy to protect trade secrets
SEC’s massive database plan starts to take shape
How not to be sanctioned by the World Bank
Expanded auditor report: take two
Risk reporting to the board
Mind the non-GAAP
Cyber-security due diligence, a new imperative

Please let me know soon if you have interested, we’re approaching others.

Thanks for your consideration.

April
