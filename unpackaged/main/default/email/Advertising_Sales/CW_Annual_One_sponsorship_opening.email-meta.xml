Sessions at Compliance Week 2015 available for a sponsor:

Managing FCPA Audits on a Global Scale
Enforcing anti-corruption policies among employees and third parties is one of the foremost concerns for compliance departments. Learn how one company developed its FCPA audit process to assess and uncover bribery risks—from planning an audit, to collecting necessary data from numerous software systems, to analyzing that information and flagging FCPA concerns that merit more formal investigation. Bring plenty of questions for this granular look at a crucial compliance exercise.

Getting a Stronger Grasp on Vendor Risks
Poor oversight of vendors is an excellent way to increase corruption, sanctions, and tax risks, among other things. This session will review ways to move beyond mere assessment of vendor risks and implement better systems to manage those risks: how to collaborate with audit and business unit leaders; how to achieve a more continuous monitoring; how to respond quickly when a vendor&apos;s risks get too high. We will walk through the reporting that can help a CCO understand the whole picture of vendor risks and present that to other stakeholders in the organization.

Developing the Right Strategy for GRC Implementation
Oh, joy: the company has decided it needs an enterprise-wide GRC software system. Now what? This session will explore all the questions and considerations you need to answer. Remember, you are changing business processes as you automate GRC functions—so what input do you need from business unit leaders? What’s the working relationship between the CCO and the IT department? What’s the strategy to accommodate future growth? And, yes, war stories will be told.

Building Effective Training Programs
Successful compliance training programs work on three principles: they clearly connect regulatory requirements to your training curriculum, and stay current with changing regulation; they deliver compliance training as part of a broader learning program; and they use a structure where compliance, HR, and workforce development teams all work together for employee improvement. This session will offer specific examples from highly regulated businesses with complex compliance needs, showing how training can work efficiently and effectively.

Smarter Risk Analysis in the Era of Big Data Analytics
The volume of corporate data, and a company’s ability to analyze it all, are both exploding. This has profound implications for corporations trying to identify possible fraud, weak spots in supply chains, or evidence to support an investigation. This session will look at new ways to employ “big analytics” for sharper insight into risk areas, and it will consider the importance of improving analytic capabilities, as regulators do the same with their own computing firepower.

Moving From Compliance Programs to Enterprise Risk Management
The annual compliance risk assessment—and modifying your program to address weaknesses you find —is a good foundation for any company, but what then? How can you take the results of that exercise and build a stronger program of enterprise risk management, with useful data for senior executives and risk-management practices embedded into business units? This session will discuss how you can move forward from compliance assessments to ERM, in ways flexible enough to move with corporate strategy and measurable enough to let you see progress.

Assessing Your Risks in Anti-Trust
Antitrust compliance is a rapidly rising concern for chief compliance officers, and not just for one industry behemoth merging with another. How do you digest antitrust regulations globally, and the conflicting legal concepts behind them? How do you scrutinize your business model and processes for antitrust risks, and assemble an enterprise-wide sense of your exposure? This session will explore those questions, and how to apply previous anti-corruption compliance wisdom to this new field.</textOnly>
