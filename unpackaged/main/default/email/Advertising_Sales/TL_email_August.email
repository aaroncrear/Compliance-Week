Compliance Week’s Thought Leadership emails are one of our most popular and cost effective lead generation programs.  Thought leadership emails promote a sponsor’s white paper, survey or upcoming webcast to our subscriber base of 40,000+ compliance executives.  Upon opening the email, a subscriber may follow a link to download an asset.  As the asset is downloaded, contact detail is captured and provided back to the sponsor.  

The cost of a thought leadership email is $5,000 and we rarely have openings in the thought leadership calendar.  However, in August we have a number of available dates.  We are currently offering a bonus of 25k website banner impressions or a banner in our weekly eNewsletter with the purchase of an August thought leadership email.    

Please let me know if you are interested in running a thought leadership email and I can provide available dates.

Thanks,
