Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Three years ago, Compliance Week held its first European conference, following the successful format of our flagship US conference.  The conference was met with strong interest from our European audience and has continued to grow in the subsequent years.  This October, Compliance Week will hold another European conference to bring together compliance professionals for keynote presentations, panel discussions, breakout sessions, and networking. Compliance Week Europe will cover corporate ethics, compliance, risk management, auditing, and more, from both a global and European perspective.  Although the agenda is still being modified, this is the current version:

We are currently seeking sponsors for the event.  Full sponsorships are available at $22,400, while smaller sponsorships start at $8,000.  Please let me know if you are interested in more information for our sponsorship opportunities.  Iâ€™d also be happy to schedule a call with our editorial team to discuss any of the sessions or any other session ideas you may have in mind.

Thanks,
April
