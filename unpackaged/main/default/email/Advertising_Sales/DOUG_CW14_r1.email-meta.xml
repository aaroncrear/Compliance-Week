    <subject>Reaching Compliance Week 2014 attendees</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

With just seven weeks to go to our Annual Compliance Week Conference, we have a few remaining sponsorship options available. This represents a prime opportunity to reach 400-500 senior GRC professionals. The event runs May 19-21 at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington D.C.

Let me know if you would like to discuss any of the programs listed below, as we would welcome the chance to partner with {!Account.Name} at the conference this year.

Exclusive: Technology Center Sponsorship | $20,000 New this year, located in the Cabinet Room (on the main floor) the Technology Center will be open to all conference attendees throughout the three-day event.

The exclusive sponsorship provides the following amenities for all delegates: Charging station, Cyber Café, wireless printer, computer, beverage station, and seated meeting space.

Exclusive: Event App Sponsor | $6,000 A large number of the 450-500 event delegates and speakers use our CW App to navigate the event. The CW App sponsor will receive:

In addition, I wanted to let you know that there’s still time to reserve a print ad in the May issue of the magazine. We consider this the year’s most important edition due to the bonus distribution to every attendee at the conference. We have a special rate of $5,332—that’s 25% off our open page rate. The deadline for space is April 10; materials are due April 15.

Please let me know if you have interest or questions. Thanks for your consideration.
