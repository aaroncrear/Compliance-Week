    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

This October, Compliance Week will host a two day conference in Brussels designed to discuss the risk &amp; compliance problems that all large multinational organizations face when doing business in Europe, and the solutions that compliance executives have found.  Iâ€™d like to see if {!Account.Name} would be interested in sponsorship.

The event will be held on October 13 &amp; 14 in Brussels at the Marriott. Attending the event will be roughly 175 legal, financial, risk &amp; compliance executives from global public companies. The event is designed to discuss issues such as:


Overview of anti-corruption laws and enforcement trends in Europe
Data privacy regimes in US, Europe and elsewhere
Effective internal investigations, especially for trans-national or data-intensive inquiries
Due diligence: How to prepare for it, and how to do it
Crafting a code of conduct that works
Encouraging whistleblowers to report misconduct
Measuring and encouraging ethical conduct

The preliminary agenda has just been released and I would be happy to send it along. The event website is http://conference.complianceweek.com/cw-europe/home-cw-europe.aspx

There are several levels of sponsorship, the cost for Presenting Sponsorship is $22,400 and includes two speaking sessions, an exhibit booth and access to all the leads for marketing. Additional sponsorship options include:

Cost of speaking position only on a large room panel: $10,000
Cost of leadership of a workshop with 12-15 execs: $10,000
Cost of an exhibit booth only: $8,000

Please let me know if you are interested in discussing or have questions. Thanks for your consideration.




-Doug
