Past Due Notice



Dear {!Opportunity.Primary_Subscription_Contact__c},

Our records indicate that payment for your subscription to Compliance Week is now 7 days past due. Maybe you’ve missed our prior notices or have outstanding questions about your subscription. We hate to lose you as a subscriber. Please contact us immediately to process payment or to let us know how we can help.

You can submit your payment online by logging into your account.

Alternatively, checks can be made out to Wilmington Compliance Week and mailed to Accounts Receivable at the address below. If you do not wish to renew, please contact me at (617) 570-8608 or reply to this email.
