    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Will you be attending Compliance Week 2019? The conference is quickly approaching  May 19-22, and today we announced new keynote speaker and former Prosecutor - Preet Bharara.

Read the notice here. &quot;Nominated by President Barack Obama, Preet Bharara served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2009 to 2017. Drawing on his experience as a prosecutor, Bharara will delve into issues of ethics and compliance, corporate responsibility, leadership, and cyber-security.
During his tenure, his officeâ€™s case against S.A.C. Capital resulted in the largest fine ever paid in the history of insider-trading prosecution.
Bharara will offer an actionable guide to growing and succeeding as an organization while engaging in ethical business practices and maintaining responsible corporate leadership.

Donna
