    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Join us at the 14th Annual Compliance Week Conference, to hear from keynote speaker Kristy Grant-Hart.

Kristy will share the qualities that the most effective compliance professionals have in common. She&apos;ll also provide insight and guidance on methods by which you can supercharge your relationships with internal stakeholders. Refresh the perception of your role and learn the strategies necessary to become a true “compliance superhero.”

Learn more about the exciting agenda that we have planned for this year&apos;s event, review what CEUs will be available, and bring a colleague to D.C. to join the conversation.
