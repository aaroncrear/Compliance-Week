    <subject>Compliance Week March Print Edition - Inside Front Cover</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We are working to close the March print edition of Compliance Week and have space available for a full page advertisement on the inside front cover.  This cover position is one of the most visible in the magazine, we typically charge a 20% premium. I’d like to see if {!Account.Name} would be interested in the position.

Because it&apos;s late and we need to fill the position by EOD Friday this week, we&apos;d be willing to give a reduced rate and include complimentary online banner impressions.

The rate card cost for the position is $7,150. I will reduce the cost to $5,500 and include 50,000 online banner impressions as added value. Materials for the print ad would be due by EOD Tuesday, February 13th.

Stories in the March print edition include:


DOJ charges fraud, conspiracy over PCAOB inspection leaks
Goodbye CFPB; it was fun while it lasted
Morrisons data breach creates additional cyber-liability
Data sharing, AI may be antidote to failing AML effort
Tax law changes could shift executive comp strategies
AI is driving better risk and reward at American Express
The China conundrum: balancing risk and reward
Post-Brexit, new U.K. sanctions laws and regulations needed
Preventing corruption in the mining sector
France fines J&amp;J over anti-competition issues

Please let me know soon if you are interested, we’re approaching others for the position.

Thanks for your consideration.




-Doug
