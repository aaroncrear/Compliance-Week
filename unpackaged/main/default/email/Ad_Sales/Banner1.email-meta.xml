    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We have some last minute online banner advertisement availability in 2017. I wanted to see if you would be interested in a nice online banner package at a steep discount. I’ve been trying to do more with {!Account.Name}, this could be an option.

If you can move before the end of October, we have 50,000 banner impressions available in November and December. Rate card cost 50k impressions is $6,000 but I can reduce the cost to $3,000. You would have to rotate between two sizes, 300x250 and 728x90 pixels. We’d need materials for both sizes. Specs:


Rectangle Banner
300x250 IMU
Files accepted: .jpg, .gif, .png
Max file size: 40K
Flash and third party tags accepted. Please request additional information for flash.

Leaderboard Website Banner
728x90
Files accepted: .jpg, .gif, .png
Max file size: 40K
Flash and third party tags accepted. Please request additional information for flash.

Let me know if you are interested or have questions.


-Doug
