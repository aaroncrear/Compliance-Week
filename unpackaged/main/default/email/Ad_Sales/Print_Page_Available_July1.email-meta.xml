    <subject>Compliance Week July Print Edition - Inside Front Cover</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We are working to close the July print edition of Compliance Week and have space available for a full page advertisement on the inside front cover.  This cover position is one of the most visible in the magazine, we typically charge a 20% premium. I’d like to see if {!Account.Name} would be interested in the position.

Because it&apos;s late and we need to fill the position by EOD Friday this week, we&apos;d be willing to give a reduced rate and include complimentary online banner impressions.

The rate card cost for the position is $7,150. I will reduce the cost to $5,500 and include 50,000 online banner impressions as added value. Materials for the print ad would be due by EOD Friday, June 15th.

The edition will be heavy in stories from our May annual conference and on political risk management (trade, sanctions, etc). Stories in the edition to include:


Trade war brewing between the US and EU
EU to decide whether to fall in line with US sanctions on Iran
How Trump sanctions are impacting Americans
Q&amp;A with Mantech on export controls and global compliance
China perspective: How will Trump’s China rules pan out
Corruption challenges index &amp; graphic
How CCOS need to  prepare for the risks they don’t know
Experts spotlight trends in FCPA self-disclosures and enforcement
White House throwing support behind AI
Benchmark survey: Top compliance programs are data-driven
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein: The value of compliance
Creating culture from the ashes of scandal
Accounting change drives new ideas about how to do business
Self-disclosure can root out conflicts of interest
Preventing and responding to harassment must involve both HR and compliance
Risk assessments, paired with emerging tech, can supercharge compliance

Please let me know soon if you are interested in this position, we’re approaching others.

Thanks for your consideration.
