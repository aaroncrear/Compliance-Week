    <subject>Compliance Week May Print Edition - Top Minds Special Edition &amp; eBook</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

This May, Compliance Week will release an edition with a special focus on our Top Minds award winners. The edition will appear in print, online, and will be distributed at our annual conference where the award winners will be introduced. I would like to approach {!Account.Name} with advertising in one of our most anticipated editions of the year.

The Top Minds edition will highlight the twelve best and brightest governance, risk, ethics, and compliance professionals. The twelve award winners each participate in an in-depth interview with a Compliance Week columnist.  A four page spread on each award recipient will appear in the May print edition, the feature will be 48+ pages and will take up over half of the print edition.

The electronic edition will be released as an eBook in late May. The eBook will be promoted to our entire active online database of  72,000 corporate financial, legal, audit, risk &amp; compliance executives at global public companies. The online promotion will generate registrations which we will share with the advertisers for marketing.

The recipients of Top Minds Awards will include:


Kim Yapchai, Chief Compliance Officer, Whirlpool
Carrie J. DiSanto, Managing Director, ERM &amp; CCO, CME Group
Bob Bowman, Director, Risk Management, Wendyâ€™s
Cindy Moehring, Sr VP and Chief Ethics &amp; Compliance Officer, Walmart

Advertising in the edition includes the print ad in May, an ad in the eBook, and access to all registration information (from the online promotion). The costs to advertise:

Half Page Advertisement - $4,250, includes access to all leads;
Full page advertisement - $6,250, includes 25k online banner impressions and access to all leads.

Materials for the special edition and eBook are due on Thursday, April 12th.
