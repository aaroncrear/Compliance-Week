Hi {!Contact.FirstName}, <p>

This May, Compliance Week will release an edition with a special focus on our Top Minds award winners. The edition will appear in print, online, and will be distributed at our annual conference where the award winners will be introduced. I would like to approach {!Account.Name} with advertising in one of our most anticipated editions of the year. <p>

The Top Minds edition will highlight the twelve best and brightest governance, risk, ethics, and compliance professionals. The twelve award winners each participate in an in-depth interview with a Compliance Week columnist.  A four page spread on each award recipient will appear in the May print edition, the feature will be 48+ pages and will take up over half of the print edition. <p>

The electronic edition will be released as an eBook in late May. The eBook will be promoted to our entire active online database of  72,000 corporate financial, legal, audit, risk & compliance executives at global public companies. The online promotion will generate registrations which we will share with the advertisers for marketing. <p>
