    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Compliance Week is going to host an event on Third Party Risk Management in NY in March. I would like to see if {!Account.Name} would be interested in sponsorship.

As a sponsor, {!Account.Name}could lead a session that we already have on our agenda or we could customize a new session. Here is an outline of the sponsorship package:

Presenting Sponsorship: $15,000
Panel speaking role
Exhibit display table
Full page ad and 250 word firm profile in electronic brochure
Logo and hyperlink on website, listed on signage and sponsor slide
Attendee list 30 days prior (then weekly thru the event)
4 conference passes plus 2 speaker passes

Please let me know if you have questions or would like to discuss.
