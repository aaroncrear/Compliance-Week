Hi {!Contact.FirstName}, <p>

We have some last minute online banner advertisement availability in 2017. I wanted to see if you would be interested in a nice online banner package at a steep discount. I’ve been trying to do more with {!Account.Name}, this could be an option. <p>

If you can move before the end of October, we have 50,000 banner impressions available in November and December. Rate card cost 50k impressions is $6,000 but I can reduce the cost to $3,000. You would have to rotate between two sizes, 300x250 and 728x90 pixels. We’d need materials for both sizes. Specs:<p>
<blockquote>

<b>Rectangle Banner</b><br>
