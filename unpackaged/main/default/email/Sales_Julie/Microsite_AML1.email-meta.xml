    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},



In December, Compliance Week is going to launch a micro-site on Anti-Money Laundering. I’d like to see if {!Account.Name}  would be interested in sponsorship.


The Compliance Week AML Micro-site will be a web page where readers can go as a resource for information. The micro-site&apos;s landing page would have its own domain name (www.complianceweek.com/AML). The micro-site would be populated by Compliance Week editorial on AML, industry information and sponsors white papers, case studies, research, webcasts, branding, etc. The layout consists of a rotating lead image, an intro blurb, and tabbed content – the page is fully customizable as each element is optional and can be moved around the page. The cost is $25,000 to launch and is all inclusive for four months. Each additional month would be priced at $3,000. A sample micro-site with no sponsor can be found at here.



The package:

Micro-site Cost

$25,000 to launch and is all inclusive for four months

$3,000 per month to maintain beyond four months


Site starts/populated with:

Sponsor blog posts (not password protected)

The blog posts are written by sponsor and are hosted by Compliance Week on our website

Compliance Week editorial on rev rec (password protected for the users)

Sponsor white papers, surveys, case studies, research, etc. (users to download on CW registration page, leads captured and provided to sponsor)

Links to sponsor webcasts/videos/podcasts

Industry resources, surveys, bench-marking data, etc.

1 Podcast, 5-7 minutes, created by Compliance Week with sponsor guest speaker, no lead generated (hosted in iTunes)

Sponsor branding/banner advertisements on micro-site


Compliance Week to drive traffic to Micro-site via:

Monthly email blasts to our entire active database of 52,000. At $5k per email blast, this is a $20,000 value

100,000 online banner impressions over four months. At $3k per 25k impressions, this is a $12k value

Link on website homepage in blue navigation bar. CW website homepage receives 150k page views per month with 40k unique visitors

Social Media: One post per month to 8,000 LinkedIn followers, 4 tweets per month to 19,000 Twitter followers


If you have guidance and resources on AML, this would be a unique way to promote it, generate leads and awareness for your firm.


Please let me know if you have questions or would like to set up a time to chat on the phone.</textOnly>
