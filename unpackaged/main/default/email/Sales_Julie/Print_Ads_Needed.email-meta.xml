    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},


We are working to close the December edition of Compliance Week and have space for a full page ad on the outside back cover. The back cover is the most visible position in the magazine, we typically charge a 20% premium for the position.



Iâ€™d like to see if {!Account.Name} would be interested in the position. Because it&apos;s late, we&apos;d waive the premium and include 25k online banner impressions at no additional cost.


Rate card for the position is $7,150 but I would reduce to $6,000. It would generate nice print and online exposure for your firm. Materials for the print ad would be due next week Tuesday, November 15th.



The print edition would reach subscribers the week of December.

Please let me know soon if you have any interest, as we are approaching other companies as well.


Thanks for your consideration.</textOnly>
