    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope all is well at {!Account.Name}.

Compliance Week has recently designed a way for advertisers to promote their software demonstration to our audience. The goal would be to generate leads which you can use for marketing. I would like to see if you would be interested in using our database of 72,000 compliance executives at global public companies to generate leads. The details:


Compliance Week Software Demonstration â€“ Sponsor would provide a 5 to 10 minute demo video file to Compliance Week to host on our website and thru TalkPoint. The demonstration would play on demand and would be archived on our site for a minimum of one year. Sponsorship of the demonstration includes promotion thru email, on our website homepage, via postings to our LinkedIn group of 9000+, and to our 20,500 Twitter followers. The cost of sponsorship is $4,000 and 75 leads are guaranteed.

Please let me know if you have questions or interest. Thanks for your consideration.
