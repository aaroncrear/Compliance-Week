    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

I hope you saw the promotional email we sent out about a HUGE discount for a single user subscription AND a pass to the annual CW conference in May.

The total cost is $1,999 ($1194 savings!)

Compliance Week 2016 is May 23-25, in Washington, D.C. check out the agenda here.

An annual subscription to CW will keep you informed throughout the year. Attached is a quick reference guide to showcase what is included.

If you&apos;d like to subscribe and attend the conference, just reply to this email and I can get you set up.

This offer does expire at the end of February.

Kind Regards,</textOnly>
