<p>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},</p>
<p>….GRC Survey Shows Disconnect on Risk. New evidence is emerging from yet another survey to show chief audit executives and audit committees are not on the same page in their view of the highest priority areas for internal audit attention.</p>
<p>Why not raise the bar and give your company the edge by subscribing to all of the latest GRC news and information at your fingertips in one easy to access location.</p>
