    <textOnly>I wanted to check in with you about reinstating your corporate license to Compliance Week.
As you can see below, your company at one time relied on us to keep you informed.
What happened?
Now is a great time to come back to Compliance Week.
We redesigned the website, and included a MY CW feature that lets you share and save important articles easily.
We know how important your time is.
You can’t spell compliance without CPE.
Get ALL of the credits you need on your time with our On-Demand CPE Library.
Just a click away with a CW license.
Let’s get you back on board!
Please give me a call or reply to this email to start a discussion.</textOnly>
