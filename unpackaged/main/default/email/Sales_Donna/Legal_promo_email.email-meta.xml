I work for Compliance Week, the leading information service on corporate compliance. As Acritas Research Ltd currently doesn’t have access to our service, I invite you to join.

Of the 50 largest law firms in the US, 28 are subscribers—including Baker &amp; McKenzie, DLA Piper, Latham &amp; Watkins, and White &amp; Case. Hundreds of attorneys and the majority of Fortune 1000 companies rely on us to keep them well informed.

Still not sure? We offer a free 10-day no-obligation trial.  Just send me a quick note and I’d be happy to set you up with access.

Please feel free to call or e-mail with any questions.


Thanks!</textOnly>
