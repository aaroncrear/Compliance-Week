    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I was unable to reach you by phone, so I&apos;m emailing you with a special offer in the hope of involving you again in the Compliance Week community. As a former subscriber, I can offer you a 21% discount off our base rate. All subscriptions to Compliance Week include:

&gt; Weekly subscriber-only newsletters providing unbiased, in-depth news and analysis (written by former regulators and practitioners) and full access to gated content on complianceweek.com.
&gt; Available in print and (searchable) digital editions, the award-winning monthly  magazine features real-world approaches, best practices, perspective, research, and  shop talk.
&gt; Unrestricted online access to free CPE Credits through our on-demand  Library of webcasts.
&gt; Discounts for registration to live events, professional networking  opportunities, and access to thought leaders and facetime with federal regulators (rates are exclusive to subscribers).
&gt; Independent and unbiased reporting. We do not offer services that could impact our ability to serve our subscribers. Period.

Here are the rates we can offer you with this special promotion:

$945.00 (normally $1,199.00) for one year or $1,699 for two years

If you  respond to this e-mail, I can renew your subscription and email you a copy of the invoice.  Please don&apos;t hesitate to call me at my direct number 617.570.8617 with any questions.
