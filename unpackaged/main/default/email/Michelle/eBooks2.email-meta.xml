    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope all is well at {!Account.Name}.

We have identified multiple eBooks which we&apos;d like to release in the second half of 2017, I would like to see if you would be interested in sponsorship.

As a sponsor to an eBook, you would be able to contribute a white paper and full page advertisement. Your logo would appear on the front cover and in all promotional materials, and your firm description would appear on the second page. You would also receive all registration information for marketing purposes.  The ebook topics we are ready to release include (stories are also listed):

Getting ready for GDPR
Sweeping changes to the EU’s data protection laws means new compliance headaches for any company that collects and handles data on citizens of the European Union. As part of the EU’s stringent new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will take effect in under a year, some companies will be required to create and appoint a new Data Protection Officer, while all companies that collect and handle data on EU citizens will have to thoroughly reassess what personally identifiable information rests on their networks on a global scale. Data management techniques and vendor assessments will also need to be reexamined. In this edition, Compliance Week will cut through all this confusion and uncertainty to ensure companies are GDPR ready. This eBook will publish in print and online in October and will have multiple sponsors. Different advertising rates apply.

Trade Sanction Compliance
Trade sanctions remain a hotly debated topic among compliance officers. In light of the slew of regulatory changes, amendments and new requirements, companies are now tasked with putting their trade sanction compliance programs in order since enforcement actions are on the rise. This ebook will explore what compliance officers need to know about trade sanctions, and will offer some best practices that top companies are using to future proof their programs.

Each eBook will be published online and will be released via email to Compliance Week’s entire active online database of 72,000 corporate financial, legal, audit, risk &amp; compliance executives at global public companies. We will also promote the eBook on our website homepage for three weeks and we’ll archive the eBook in our online library for one year. The online promotion will generate a MINIMUM of 300 registrations with all registration information shared with the sponsor.  The cost for exclusive sponsorship for each eBook is $15,000 and benefits include:

Full page advertisement in the eBook
White paper in the eBook (content prepared and formatted by the sponsor)
Logo on all promotional materials including front cover
Company description on page two of the eBook
Ability to cross promote the eBook to own clients
Leads from all promotion (minimum 300 leads guaranteed)

Please let me know if you have questions or would like to see a sample eBook. Thanks for your consideration.
