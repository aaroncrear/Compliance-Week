    <subject>Compliance Week September Print Edition - Inside Cover</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We are working to close the September print edition of Compliance Week and have space available for a full page advertisement on the outside back cover. The outside back cover is the most visible position in the magazine.

I’d like to see if {!Account.Name} would be interested in the position. Because it&apos;s late and we need to fill the position by Thursday we&apos;d be willing to give a reduced rate and include complimentary online banner impressions.

The rate card cost for the position is $7,150. I will reduce the cost to $5,500 and include 50,000 online banner impressions as added value. Materials for the print ad would be due by EOD Thursday this week, August 10th

Stories in the September edition will look at:


Artifacts and artwork can collect trouble - A look at how Hobby Lobby violated sanctions and other international law in its acceptance of looted Babylonian artifacts and then resold them as art supplies.
BNP Paribas faces fresh accusations over involvement with Rwandan genocide - France’s largest bank is facing fresh allegations over how it processed transactions by the Rwandan government that helped facilitate the 1994 genocide.
The compliance side of the war on drugs - Feds punish a maker of generic oxycodone for failing to sufficiently monitor its own sales distribution to see if anyone is abusing their product.
Add tax to the growing list of revenue recognition crises - Taxation details are making compliance with the approaching rev rec standard that much more complicated.
Australia mulls modern slavery act - Australia looks at its own rule making to battle modern slavery.
Mexico anti-corruption - Mexico cracks down on all forms of corruption, but especially that which involves the public sector.
SCOTUS on whistleblower protections - The Supreme Court weighs in on the perpetually divisive issue of protecting whistleblowers.
Distilling lessons from FCPA Pilot Program - The lowdown on how the Pilot Program has affected FCPA enforcement and how you can better comply with the law and not get into trouble.
CFPB courts even more controversy with arbitration rule - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau wants to kill the forced arbitration rule preventing class actions against companies for predatory behavior.

Please let me know soon if you are interested, we’re approaching others.

Thanks for your consideration.
