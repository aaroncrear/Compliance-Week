    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We recently changed the service provider that we use to send our email newsletters. This has led to a high bounce rate from your company&apos;s servers. To guarantee you receive the newsletters you have selected, please contact your network administrator to add the following host addresses to your company&apos;s e-mail SPAM filter &quot;whitelist&quot;:

 Host
 Address
 
 mail3539.haymarketmedia.mkt4136.com
 74.121.48.24
 
 mail3573.mkt4170.com
 74.121.48.58
 
 mail3575.mkt4172.com
 74.121.48.60

 mail3572.mkt4169.com
 74.121.48.57

You will only receive e-mail newsletters from Compliance Week through those servers.

Best regards,
