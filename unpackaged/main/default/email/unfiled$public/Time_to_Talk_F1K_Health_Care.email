<p>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},</p>
<p>May I ask for a few moments of your time for a brief phone conversation?</p>
<p>I work for <a href="www.complianceweek.com">Compliance Week</a>, an information service on corporate compliance and I noticed {!Account.Name} currently doesnâ€™t have access to our service. We provide critical, independent guidance for financial, legal, risk, audit, and compliance executives at public companies such as Amgen, Inc., Genzyme Corporation, Eli Lilly & Co. and LifePoint Hospitals. Thousands of these executives and the majority of Fortune 1000 companies rely on us to keep them well informed.</p>
<p>Can we talk for 10 minutes this week to discuss how we can help {!Account.Name}? If there is a better time, or you feel I should speak with someone else, please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
