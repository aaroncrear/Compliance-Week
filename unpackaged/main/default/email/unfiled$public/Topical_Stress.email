<p>I thought you'd find this of interest. According to a <a href="http://www.complianceweek.com/study-finds-compliance-officers-are-highly-stressed/article/222865/">recent study</a> on stress, an increase in public attention on corporate integrity has resulted in loss of sleep for compliance officers. The survey found that 58 percent of the survey respondents say they often wake up in the middle of the night worrying about job-related stress.  The study also reported 58 percent of respondents are either in an adversarial situation at work or are isolated from their coworkers in other departments.</p>
