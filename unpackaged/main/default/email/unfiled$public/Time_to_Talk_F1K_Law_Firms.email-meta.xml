    <name>Time to Talk F1K Law Firms</name>

    <subject>Can we set a time to talk this week?</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

May I ask for a few moments of your time for a brief phone conversation?

I work for Compliance Week, an information service on corporate compliance and I noticed {!Account.Name} currently doesnâ€™t have access to our service. Of the 50 largest law firms in the US, 28 are subscribers -- including Baker &amp; McKenzie, DLA Piper, Latham &amp; Watkins, and White &amp; Case. Hundreds of attorneys and the majority of Fortune 1000 companies rely on us to keep them well informed.

Can we talk for 10 minutes this week to discuss how we can help {!Account.Name}? If there is a better time, or you feel I should speak with someone else, please let me know.

Thanks!

Donna O&apos;Neill
