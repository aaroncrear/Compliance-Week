    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Thank you for being a Compliance Week subscriber. We’ve noticed that you’re signed up to receive the Compliance Week print magazine, however we don’t have your mailing address.

Can you please email me your preferred mailing address so that we can update your record, and ensure delivery of the magazine?

Additionally, this week you’ll receive notice of the relaunch of Compliance Week’s Website on Thursday, May 2. Rebuilt from the ground up, the platform will offer improved navigation, a clean design, faster load times, and a host of new features:

Thank you,
