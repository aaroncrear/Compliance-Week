<p>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},</p>
<p>Neil Baker, Compliance Week's London correspondent, predicts that "with Dodd-Frank Act rulemaking nearly complete, 2013 might be a slightly quieter year for regulatory change in the U.S. . . Not so for Europe and other global regions. Global regulators, accounting standard setters, and foreign enforcement agencies have a full pipeline of new initiatives, many of which will affect U.S. businesses. Here are <a href="http://www.complianceweek.com/top-10-global-compliance-trends-to-watch-in-2013/article/272941/">10 developments to watch</a> on the global compliance front in the coming year."</p>
