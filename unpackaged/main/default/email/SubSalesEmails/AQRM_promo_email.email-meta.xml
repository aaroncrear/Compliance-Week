I work for Compliance Week, the leading information service on corporate compliance. As {!Account.Name} currently doesn’t have access to our service, I invite you to join and receive a custom Accounting Quality + Risk Matrix (AQRM) report by Audit Analytics. This due diligence report has a $500 value, and it is available as a complimentary benefit for a limited time.  

Compliance Week provides critical, independent guidance for financial, legal, risk, audit, and compliance executives at public companies such as Goldman Sachs, the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., NYSE, and Visa.  

Activate your license today, and your AQRM report will be delivered within 10 days … Simply reply to this e-mail to begin your subscription for $999.  

Still not sure? I’d be happy to share with you a sample AQRM report, or you can sign up for a free 10-day no-obligation trial.  

Please feel free to call or e-mail with any questions.  

Thanks!</textOnly>
