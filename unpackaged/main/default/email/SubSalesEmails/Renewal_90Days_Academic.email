Hi {!Contact.FirstName}, hope all is well with you.

I wanted to let you know that your Compliance Week license is expiring on {!Contact.Expiration_Date__c}.

To confirm your renewal at the academic rate (half the price of our corporate subscription), simply reply to this e-mail and write "I agree" -- and also whether you'd like to renew for one year ($599) or two years ($1,198). Your license fee won't be due until {!Contact.00N70000002Vvy1}.

Your reply will confirm that you agree to the terms below. Then we will email you an invoice and process the order immediately while we wait for payment. (If you want to pay by credit card, you can call us at any time at (888) 519-9200 after you receive your invoice.)
