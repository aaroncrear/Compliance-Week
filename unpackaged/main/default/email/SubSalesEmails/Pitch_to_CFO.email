{!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to ensure you were aware that {!Account.Name}’s corporate subscription to Compliance Week has expired so your company can no longer access Compliance Week resources.

I’m hopeful this is just an oversight and if so, please let me know and I can immediately reactivate {!Account.Name}'s account. I look forward to hearing from you.

With warm regards,

Donna O'Neill
