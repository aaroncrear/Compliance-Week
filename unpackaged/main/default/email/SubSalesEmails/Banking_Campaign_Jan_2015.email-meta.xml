    <subject>Do you have a risk-management approach to compliance?</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

You saw what BofA did recently (see it here: www.complianceweek.com/bofamove), taking an overt risk-management approach by shifting compliance out of legal, avoiding regulatory fees and simplifying operations.

Regulators are looking at your already complex compliance program.

Keep access to resources and trends simple by making Compliance Week available to your whole team.

Until Jan. 31st, we are offering a 3-5-user upgrade price of $2,999 (a $500 discount off our typical $3,499 rate).
That means you can add up to 5 additional subscribers for just $2,999 ... less than $599 each.
This is a substantial discount when compared to the $1,199 rate for a single-user license.
Your single-user license would become part of the multi-user license, and it would run for one full year from the date of the upgrade.

Interested? Let me know, and I can help get this set up right away.

Cheers,</textOnly>
