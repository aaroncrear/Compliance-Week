Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks so much for your patience as we try and navigate these uncertain times.  Here is an update on where things stand.  We will be hosting a virtual day of TPRM on September 17th.  This will be at no additional charge.  We are also in the process of planning for the live event to take place in March 2021.

We are offering our attendees a few options.  We can move your existing registration over to our March 2021 event or provide you with a voucher for the full amount paid to be used at a future Compliance Week event.

Please feel free to call or email with any questions or concerns.


Thanks {!Contact.FirstName}!
