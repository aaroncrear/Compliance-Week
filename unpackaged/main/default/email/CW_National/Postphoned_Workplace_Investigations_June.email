Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I'm so sorry to report that our presenter, Michael Johnson must postpone our scheduled class this week.  Michael's mom passed away unexpectantly. 

We do hope to reschedule the class later this month and will reach out once we're able to confirm a date.  

I apologize for any inconvenience.  Please feel free to call or email with any questions.

Thanks {!Contact.FirstName}!
