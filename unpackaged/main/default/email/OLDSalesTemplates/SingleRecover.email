Dear {!Contact.FirstName}:
 
 
I understand your subscription to Compliance Week recently expired, and I'd love to hear why you did not renew your subscription.
 
Was the content irrelevant? Did your job change? Anything we could have done better?
 
Thanks so much for taking the time to respond.
 
Thank you again, and good luck,
